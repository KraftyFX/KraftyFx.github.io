# Frequenty Asked Questions #
## 1.  Can I invoke a custom menu item in the Scripts or Window menu? ##
Yes.  You need to type it EXACTLY as it appears in the menu.

## 2.  When I click the button it says "Could not run menu item ..."  What do I do? ##
First, find the command ID for the menu command you want from [David Torno's PDF](https://www.provideocoalition.com/after-effects-menu-command-ids/).  There might be more than one.

If that doesn't work it means the command you want can't be run b/c of the state AE is in.  You'll have to write a script(let) to work around it.
